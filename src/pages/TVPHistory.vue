        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-tvp-blue mb-2">Summary</h2>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">The phrase ‘The Venus Project’ refers to a 501(c)3 organization and its emerging collective body of work but carries additional meanings which include:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 text-gray-800">
          <li>The Venus Project ‘Center’ in Venus, Florida, United States</li>
          <li>The body of work of <a href="https://www.frescofoundation.org/" target="_blank" class="underline text-tvp-blue">Jacque Fresco</a> and Roxanne Meadows</li>
          <li>A brand of sustainability media</li>
          <li>A philosophy, system of thought, value system, models of reality, vision of the future, etc.</li>
          <li>A collective of people who advocate all of the above</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">The Venus Project as a name was incorporated in 1994 by Jacque Fresco and Roxanne Meadows and converted to a 501(c)3 nonprofit in 2018. The Venus Project continued under the direction of Jacque Fresco until he died in 2017 at age 101. The Venus Project now maintains a board of directors and multiple teams who continue to evolve a design response to emerging global circumstances.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">The organizational continuity of The Venus Project dates as far back as 1971. Its conceptual origins date back to the 1960s, but its philosophy traces back much earlier.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-tvp-blue mb-2">Recent History</h2>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">From 1976 to 2017, Jacque Fresco was assisted by Roxanne Meadows to amass a large body of work consisting of thousands of lectures, drawings, schematic illustrations, and tabletop models representing an alternative global socioeconomic system. For decades, Fresco promoted his work through several books, videos, articles, publicity, and public lectures.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">From 1980 to 2006, Fresco and Meadows constructed 10 buildings in a rural community called Venus in Florida, United States. This was a testing ground and demonstration site of several architectural methods. <a href="https://www.thevenusproject.com/visit/" target="_blank" class="underline text-tvp-blue">Tours of this location remain open to the public.</a></p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">Since 2008, The Venus Project has presented a leading vision of sustainability. The Great Recession of 2008 provoked much demand for economic alternatives. Fresco and Meadow’s years of preparation converged with the hard work of several filmmakers to popularize The Venus Project to a global audience.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">Since then, Fresco’s work has influenced a wide range of movements, communities, and industrial sectors. The Venus Project has since undergone extensive exploration of global energy and materials constraints and now builds upon the foundational work of Jacque Fresco to confront the challenges of global overshoot.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-tvp-blue mb-2">Sociocyberneering</h2>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">Prior to The Venus Project, Fresco directed Sociocyberneering Inc. a non-profit organization he founded in 1971 in Miami, Florida. During this time Fresco refined the bulk of the ideas that he would later present as The Venus Project. Fresco’s visionary concepts were calibrated to the era’s energy, materials, and global population, and offered a forethinking response to global socio-economic reality.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">Foreseeing an unsustainable world, he emphasized sustainable resource management and addressed diverse challenges such as consumerism, waste, war, poverty, and politics. His forward-thinking ideas aimed to prevent the trajectory leading to the current situation depicted by the <a href="https://www.clubofrome.org/blog-post/herrington-world-model/" target="_blank" class="underline text-tvp-blue">BAU2 scenario in the Limits to Growth</a>.</p>

      <section class="glassy-bg rounded-3xl shadow-xl mb-12 p-8 animate-fade-in-up" aria-label="Jacque Fresco’s History">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-tvp-blue mb-2">Jacque Fresco’s History</h2>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">Jacque Fresco was born in New York City in 1916. The hardships of the Great Depression had a profound impact on his social conscience, and this experience gave purpose to his later work. From a young age, he gained experience in diverse industries and positions. In Los Angeles, CA, Fresco worked primarily in the aerospace industry, drafting and designing aircraft and parts. He further worked in architecture, focusing on prefabricated residential and industrial structures. He maintained a passion for basic science and conducted many experiments in his laboratory. As an industrial designer, he pursued many inventions for household items and appliances, medical equipment, entertainment, transportation, and manufacturing.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">In Miami, FL, Fresco later extended his services to the human domain by offering psychological consultations. This and other diverse experiences, such as interactions with indigenous tribes and dealing with various dysfunctional organizations and groups, provided early exposure to problems associated with human factors and became a central focus of his work. By the 1970s, Fresco shifted his time to near-exclusive dedication to global redesign.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">Jacque Fresco was born in 1916 and spent his young adult life struggling through the Depression, which informed his ideas about the economy and society as he grew older. He was a self-taught designer and architect who championed pre-fabricated homes in the 50s and 60s but his real passion was the future.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">In 1969, he published a book called <em>Looking Forward</em>, which imagined a future society where technology has made it possible for everyone to have their needs met.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">He continued on this line of thinking for the rest of his life, eventually forming The Venus Project with Roxanne Meadows, advocating for a resource-based economy.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">And that social model is an entirely new economy that is not based on money, where automation and technology provides all our basic needs, nobody has to work, there’s no crime, no poverty, no waste, and it’s totally sustainable.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">The Venus Project’s plan for smart cities is to incorporate a circular design, with the central hub housing the core of the cybernated system that controls resource management, educational and healthcare facilities, and communications networks.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">Radiating out from there in all directions are concentric rings of buildings housing office space, institutions, and research laboratories.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">Surrounding that is a green belt providing recreation and parks, then a residential belt with pre-fabricated homes.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">From there, we find a band of apartment buildings and high-rises, again made from preformulated, modular pieces that also contain entertainment venues, theaters, and restaurants. Then an agricultural belt that grows all the food for the city along with hydroponic, aquaponic, and aeroponic facilities.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">A circular waterway surrounds the agricultural belt for irrigation, and last but not least, a second recreation belt with paths for walking and biking, golf courses, and outdoor activities.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">Anybody who’s been to Disney World in Florida or just watched the Disney Channel when they were kids knows about Epcot Center, but what you may not know was that the original plan for Epcot was something much, much more ambitious.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">Epcot stands for Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow. According to Disney’s vision, it would be an ever-evolving city designed to test the newest and greatest ideas in housing and urban planning. It would be connected by monorail to the theme park and would house the employees of the park.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">But Epcot is not alone. From Octagon City in 1850’s Kansas to England’s Ebenezer Howard and his radial Garden City at the turn of the century to Broadacre City, planned by none other than Frank Lloyd Wright, the circular, modular city of the future is something that always seems to be planned… but never executed.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">Earlier this year a company called Sidewalk Labs, a subsidiary of the Alphabet umbrella that includes Google, purchased 12 acres of waterfront property in Toronto, with the goal of testing out smart city designs and technology.</p>
